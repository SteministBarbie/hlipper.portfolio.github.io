          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Ancient History</h3>
              <p>As a teenager in the 1990s, I was swept up by a passion for musical and creative self-expression.
                Rumor had it Chicago was about to become the next Seattle.  As soon as I could, I scraped together enough
               money to rent a run-down Victorian storefront with four guys and a three-legged cat.  I rehearsed six
              days a week, convinced my hard work would pay off eventually;  someday I would be able to tap into a bit
             of the magic I felt listening to music written by others.</p>

                <p>Years went by.  I worked desk jobs to pay the bills.  I began to recognize a factor I hadn’t
                 yet considered in how local bands, offering up relatively similar experiences and content, were
                perceived by audiences.  I started to understand that the most successful acts had a designer among
              their ranks, or waiting in the wings, who could  skillfully modulate the perception of the band’s
            standard indie rock fare with images, typography, color and words.  I tried to understand what was
          affecting us. </p>

              <h3>Life Goes On</h3>
                <p>Eventually, after years of false starts and other minor disasters, my musical peer group
                began to fall away.  One by one, old friends I relied on for feedback and support jumped ship
              to take on more traditional roles.  They scattered across the country, started families, and I
            was left to do some serious identity work.  I could not abandon my desire to focus on meaningful
          reative work and ideas.</p>
              <h3>A Way Forward...</h3>
                <p>I come to the design field with twenty years of work experience, bundled with an exciting
                 new parcel of developing skills.  I have an undying fascination with human creative self-expression
               - and a need to solve it’s many mysteries.   I can bring all of this and more to your projects.</p>
