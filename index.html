          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a teenager in the 1990s, I was swept up by a passion for musical and creative self-expression.
            All of my friends heard the same whisperings that I did.  Who knows from where they sprung?
            Still, the message was clear.  Move to Chicago.  Chicago is about to become the next  Seattle...
            As soon as I could, I scraped together enough money to rent a run-down Victorian storefront with four guys and a three-legged cat.
            I rehearsed six days a week, convinced my hard work would pay off eventually;  someday I would be able to tap into a bit of the
            magic I felt listening to music written by others.</p>

            <p>Years went by.  I worked desk jobs to pay the bills.  I began to recognize a factor I hadn’t yet considered in how different bands,
            offering up relatively similar experiences and content, were perceived by audiences.  I started to understand that the most successful
            acts had a designer among their ranks, or waiting in the wings, who could  skillfully modulate the perception of the band’s standard
            indie rock fare with images, typography, color and words.</p>

            <p>I tried to understand what was affecting us.  I visited museums, read books, but found nothing much that could really clue me in on the
            mechanics of it.  My music was heard by few.</p>

            <p>Eventually, after years of false starts and other minor disasters, my musical peer group began to fall away.  One by one,
            old friends I relied on for feedback and support jumped ship to take on more traditional roles.  They scattered across the country,
            started families, and I was left to do some serious identity work.  I could not abandon my desire to focus on meaningful, creative
            projects and dig deeper into the realm of ideas.  Who am I really? What is my way forward?
            Circumstances forced me to ask these things of myself.</p>

            <p>I come to the design field with twenty years of work experience, bundled with an exciting new parcel of developing skills.  I have
            more than a little grit stuck in my hair and under my nails at this point, and I can bring all of this and more to your projects.</p>
